# python-md5-hash
A python script to hash all rockyou.txt passwords.

As a Penetration Tester, I had to brute force a web login form, that was converting all of my input to md5. Therefore, I decided to write a quick script that goes through the rockyou.txt file and hash each line using the md5 algorithm.
